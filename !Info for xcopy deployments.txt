LINQPAD AND XCOPY-DEPLOYMENTS

LINQPad7.zip contains launchers for all supported architectures:

LINQPad7-x64.exe    // for X64
LINQPad7-x86.exe    // for X86 - choose this if you need to reference native 32-bit DLLs
LINQPad7-arm64.exe  // for ARM64 machines such as Surface Pro X

For command-line support:

LPRun7-x64.exe    // X64
LPRun7-x86.exe    // X86
LPRun7-arm64.exe  // ARM64

It is recommended that you rename/copy the launcher that corresponds to your native platform to LPRun7.exe.

All of LINQPad's launchers work with .NET 3.1 -> .NET 6.0.
If no compatible .NET has been installed, the launcher will bootstrap its installation.
